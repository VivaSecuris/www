                The rise of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and telemedicine has made data breaches more prevalent. Imagine waking up to news that over 41 million healthcare records have been exposed in a single year, leading to widespread identity theft and compromised patient privacy [source: HIPAA Journal]. This is the reality we face today.

                Proper scanning of medical device software is crucial to ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance. It helps identify vulnerabilities and potential security threats before they can be exploited, preventing malfunctions that could lead to severe health risks. Additionally, thorough scanning safeguards sensitive patient data, maintaining trust and upholding the integrity of healthcare systems.
